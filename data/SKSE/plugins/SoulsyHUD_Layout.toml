# How to align name and count text for this text element.
# IMPORTANT DOCUMENTATION! The options are left, right, center.
# Text alignment is, for cognitive ease reasons, also a statement about
# where the stated anchor point is.

# Left alignment: the offset refers to the center of the left edge.
# Right alignment: the offset refers to the center of the right edge.

#     contents = "Hello, world!"
# or it can substitute in values from the item shown in the slot.
# To fill in a value, use it with curly braces, like this
# example, which draws the name of the item shown. You can use more
# than one.
# Possible values: count, name, kind,
